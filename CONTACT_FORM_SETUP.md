# Contact Form Setup

The contact form is configured to use **FormSubmit**, a free service for handling form submissions.

## How It Works

The form is already set up and working! Messages will be sent to: **RicRebullWork@gmail.com**

### First Time Setup

The first time someone submits the form, FormSubmit will send a confirmation email to verify your email address. You need to:

1. Submit a test message through your contact form
2. Check your email (RicRebullWork@gmail.com) for a confirmation from FormSubmit
3. Click the confirmation link
4. After confirmation, all future form submissions will be sent directly to your email

## Features Enabled

- ✅ **Custom Subject Line**: "New contact from portfolio website!"
- ✅ **No CAPTCHA**: Disabled for better user experience
- ✅ **Table Format**: Emails formatted in a clean table layout
- ✅ **Form Validation**: All fields required
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices

## How to Test

1. Visit your contact page
2. Fill out the form with test data
3. Submit the form
4. Check your email for the confirmation (first time only)
5. Click the confirmation link
6. Test again - you should receive the message directly!

## Additional Configuration (Optional)

You can add more features by adding hidden inputs to the form. See [FormSubmit documentation](https://formsubmit.co/) for options like:

- Custom success page redirect
- CC/BCC emails
- Auto-response to sender
- And more!
